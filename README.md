This simple app use LCU to collect and visual data from game




## Usage

To correct work you need to have open League Client in which you have the match you want to visualize in your match history
1. Install latest [release](https://github.com/Antos99999/LCU/releases/latest)
2. Download folder (with fils) [ImageToUse](https://github.com/Antos99999/LCU/tree/master/ImageToUse)
3. In first input put your match ID (only number)
4. In secound input put winner team tag (max 8 characters)

**NOTE**\
I recommended to put .exe file in separeted folder (for example on Desktop), because program will create some extra folders to  data storage (mostly images)
